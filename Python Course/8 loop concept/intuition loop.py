"""
In first scenario you know the number of mugs to transfer
from one bucket to another.>
 Here you know how many numbers of iteration you have
to go through, like you have to transfer only 4 mugs.>
 So when you know the number of iterations you will use a
FOR loop.
 In the second scenario, you don't know how many mugs you
need to transfer, but you do know the condition that
determines when to stop
 So when you don’t know how many iteration you have to
use but you know a condition that determines when to
stop you will use loop. WHILE
