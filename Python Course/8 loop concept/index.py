"""
Loops in Python allow us to execute a block of code multiple
times without rewriting it
 Ok lets do one thing go to your VS code and print “hello
world” 100 times
 Manually printing will take 100 code lines to print it. but using
loops we need only 2 lines to print 100 times, thats the
power of loops.

 There are 2 types of loops in python. For and While loop.

 For understanding both types of loop we well see a great
example- you have a bucket filled with water and an empty
bucket with a mug.

# In scenario 1 you have to transfer 4 mugs of water from 1
# bucket to another
#  In scenario 2 you have to transfer all the water from 1st
# bucket to another via mug.
