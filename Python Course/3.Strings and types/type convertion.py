                        3 For understanding type conversion you have to look at these
                            4 things
                                    int()  . float() . str()   . bool()

                        3 There are more functions like this but these are 4 main 
                              function, looking at these functions you can guess these are
                             used to convert one data type to another
                         3 eg a = 12
                              a = str(a)
                             print(a) ==> “12” (a will be converted to string)
