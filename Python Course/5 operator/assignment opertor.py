# compound assignment operator :

"""
Compound assignment operator combines arithmetic

 But first you have to understand how things work when we
reassign variables in python and also reassigning variables
with addition, subtraction etc
 To understand watch the video carefully
 Using compound assignment operators the reassigning
 
 works better

 *=            Multiply and assignA
 /=            Divide and assigD
 //=           Floor divide and assigD
 %= modulus and assigD
 **= Exponentiation and assign
